# Wizard

Wizard is a D&D text-based game that involves battles between a wizard and creatures & wizards. 
By playing as the wizard Gandolf your mission is to slay all the enemies that you come accross, but don't worry if you think an enemy is a hard one (Evil wizard, Dragon) you can allways run away !


## Getting Started
Wizards is a pure Python game made with Python 3 by using inheritance from classes.
